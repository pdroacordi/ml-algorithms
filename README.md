# Machine Learning Algorithms for Heart Disease Classification
*** 
## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms applied to a binary classification problem: predicting whether a patient has a heart condition or not. The algorithms implemented include:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
The Jupyter notebooks cover the entire process from data pre-processing to model training and evaluation.
***
## Dataset
The dataset used is the Heart Disease Dataset, which includes various medical attributes related to heart health. The goal is to predict the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease in patients based on these attributes.

Features include: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise and slope of the peak exercise ST segment.

## Algorithms Implemented
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   * Description: A non-parametric method used for classification by comparing distances between data points.
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   * Description: A supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification using hyperplanes.
3. **Decision Tree**
   * Description: A model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from data features.
4. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
   * Description: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks, capable of modeling complex patterns.
